# openCRACE
open Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Control Engine

open CRACE (Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Control Engine) is a free and open-source command-line interface (CLI) and GitHub Action designed to help organizations of all sizes meet the mandatory cybersecurity risk assessment requirements of the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA).

Inspired by structured risk assessment methodologies like those from ETSI, open CRACE provides a data-driven framework for evaluating and managing product cybersecurity risk.

The tool operates on a set of core principles:

Risk Identification and Characterization: It systematically identifies potential cybersecurity risks by analyzing a product's attributes, such as its architecture, dependencies, and intended use.

Quantitative Risk Scoring: It uses a scoring system to assign an initial risk score for each identified risk based on its probability and impact, ensuring a consistent and objective assessment.

Control-Based Mitigation: open CRACE goes beyond simple assessment by providing a curated catalog of default security controls. Users can select and apply these controls, and the tool will then calculate a residual risk score to demonstrate the effectiveness of the chosen mitigations. This provides a clear, quantitative measure of risk reduction.

Reporting and Compliance: The tool generates machine-readable and human-readable reports, making it easy to document the risk assessment process and demonstrate compliance with EU CRA requirements.

By automating the risk assessment and control-evaluation process, open CRACE empowers developers and security teams to build secure products from the start, integrate security into their CI/CD pipelines, and maintain a clear, auditable record of their cybersecurity posture.
